 * Use a Tri-gram model to get

 *
 * Description: 
 * ----------------------------------------
 * The program uses a file
 * containing probabilities of characters
 * given a sequence. This file is created
 * at random. The probabilities in the file
 * is used to calculate the probability
 * of a user input string of the characters
 * A, B, or C only.
